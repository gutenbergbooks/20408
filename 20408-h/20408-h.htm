<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ENGLISH BOOKS OF EMBLEMS.</h3>

  <p>It is a remarkable circumstance that whilst the emblems of Alciatus
  Vent through almost innumerable editions, and were translated into most
  of the continental languages, no version of these Emblems should ever
  have been printed in this country, although we believe that MS.
  translations of them are in existence. It is remarkable also that more
  than half century should have elapsed after their appearance, before any
  English publication on this subject should have been committed to the
  press. Our English authors of Books of Emblems were not only late in
  their appearance, but are few in number, and in their embellishments not
  very original, the plates being for the most part mere copies of those
  already published abroad by Herman Hugo, Rollenhagius, and others. The
  notices of the English writers on this entertaining subject are also but
  meagre and imperfect, and restricted to a very few works; both Dibdin, in
  his slight and rapid sketch on Books of Emblems in the <i>Bibliogr.
  Decam.</i>, vol. i. p. 254., and the writer in the <i>Retrosp. Rev.</i>,
  vol. ix. p. 123., having confined their remarks to some one or two of the
  leading writers only, Arwaker, Peacham, Quarles, Whitney, and Wither.
  With the exception of an occasional article in the <i>Bibl. Ang.
  Poet.</i>, <i>Cens. Liter. Restituta</i>, and similar bibliographical
  volumes, we are not aware that any other notice has been taken of this
  particular branch of our literature<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, nor does there exist, <!-- Page 470
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page470"></a>{470}</span> that we know
  of, any complete, separate, and distinct catalogue of such works.</p>

  <p>Being anxious, therefore, to obtain a correct account of what may be
  termed the English Series of Books of Emblems, I inclose a list of all
  those in my own possession, and of the titles of such others as I have
  been able to collect; and I shall be glad if any of your readers can make
  any additions to the series, confining them at the same time strictly to
  Books of Emblems, and not admitting fables, heraldic works, or older
  publications not coming within the same category. A good comprehensive
  work on this subject of Books of Emblems, not confined merely to the
  English series, but embracing the whole foreign range, giving an account
  both of the writers of the verses, and also of the engravers, and the
  different styles of art in each, is still a great desideratum in our
  literary history; and if ably and artistically done, with suitable
  illustrations of the various engravings and other ornaments, would form a
  very interesting, instructive, and entertaining volume; and I sincerely
  hope that the time will not be far distant when such a volume will be
  found in our libraries.</p>

  <p>I conclude with a Query of inquiry, whether anything is known of the
  present resting-place of a <i>Treatise on Emblems</i>, which the late Mr.
  Beloe informs us, at the close of his <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. vi.
  p. 406., he had written at "considerable length," from communications
  furnished him by the Marquis of Blandford, whose collection of Emblems
  was at that time one of the richest and most extensive in the kingdom,
  and whose treatise, if published, might perhaps prove a valuable addition
  to our information on this portion of our literature.</p>

  <p>I would also inquire who was Thomas Combe, and what did he write, who
  is thus mentioned by Meres in his <i>Palladis Tamia: Wits Treasury</i>,
  Lond. 1598, 8vo., as one of our English writers of Emblems: "As the
  Latines have those emblematists, Andreas Alciatus, Reusnerus, and
  Sambucus, so we have these, Geffrey Whitney, Andrew Willet, and <i>Thomas
  Combe</i>." Is anything known of the latter, or of his writings?</p>

<h3>AUTHOR OF TRACT ON "ADVANTAGES OF THE EAST
INDIA TRADE, 1720, 8vo."</h3>

  <p>Of this pamphlet, originally published in 1701, 8vo., under the title
  of <i>Considerations upon the East India Trade</i>, and afterwards in
  1720, 8vo., with a new title-page, <i>The Advantages of the East India
  Trade to England considered</i>, containing <!-- Page 472 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page472"></a>{472}</span> 128 pages, inclusive
  of Preface, the author never yet been ascertained.</p>

  <p>Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Culloch accords to it, and very deservedly, the
  highest praise. He styles it (<i>Literature of Political Economy</i>, p.
  100.) "a profound, able, and most ingenious tract;" and observes that he
  has "set the powerful influence of the division of labour in the most
  striking point of view, and has illustrated it with a skill and felicity
  which even Smith has not surpassed, but by which he most probably
  profited." Addison's admirable paper in <i>The Spectator</i> (No. 69.) on
  the advantages of commerce, is only an expansion of some of the
  paragraphs in this pamphlet. In some parts I think he has scarcely
  equalled the force of his original. Take, for instance, the following
  sentences, which admit of fair comparison:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"We taste the spices of Arabia, yet never feel the scorching sun which
  brings them forth; we shine in silks which our hands have never wrought;
  we drink of vineyards which we never planted; the treasures of those
  mines are ours which we have never digged; we only plough the deep, and
  reap the harvest of every country in the world."&mdash;<i>Advantages of
  East India Trade</i>, p. 59.</p>

  <p>"Whilst we enjoy the remotest products of the north and south, we are
  free from those extremities of weather which give them birth; our eyes
  are refreshed with the green fields of Britain, at the same time that our
  palates are feasted with fruits that rise between the
  tropics."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, No. 69.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Culloch makes no conjecture as to the probable author
  of this very able tract; but it appears to me that it may on good grounds
  be ascribed to Henry Martyn, who afterwards&mdash;not certainly in
  accordance with the enlightened principles he lays down in this
  pamphlet&mdash;took an active part in opposing the treaty of commerce
  with France, and was rewarded by the appointment of Inspector-General of
  the exports and imports of the customs. (See an account of him in Ward's
  <i>Lives of Gresham Professors</i>, p. 332.) He was a contributor to
  <i>The Spectator</i>, and Nos. 180. 200. and 232. have been attributed to
  him; and the matter of Sir Andrew Freeport's speculations appears to have
  been furnished by him as Addison and Steele's oracle on trade and
  commerce. It will be seen that in No. 232. he makes exactly the same use
  of Sir William Petty's example of the watch as is done in the tract
  (p.69.), and the coincidence seems to point out one common author of both
  compositions. But, without placing too much stress on this similarity, I
  find, that Collins's <i>Catalogue</i>, which was compiled with great
  care, and where it mentions the authors of anonymous works may always be
  relied upon, attributes this tract to Martyn (Collins's <i>Cat</i>.
  1730-1, 8vo., Part I., No. 3130.). I have a copy of the edition of 1701,
  in the original binding and lettering&mdash;lettered "Martyn on the East
  India Trade "&mdash;and copies of the edition of 1720 in two separate
  collections of tracts; one of which belonged to A. Chamier, and the other
  to George Chalmers; in both of which the name of Martyn is written as its
  author on the title-page, and in the latter in Chalmers's handwriting. I
  think therefore we may conclude that this tract, which well deserves
  being more generally known than it is at present, was written by Henry
  Martyn.</p>

<h3>"AKE" AND ACHE.</h3>

  <p>John Kemble, it is well known, maintained that the latter was the mode
  of pronouncing this word in Shakspeare's days. He was right, and he was
  wrong; for, as I shall show, both modes prevailed, at least in poetry,
  till the end of the seventeenth century. So it was with some other words,
  <i>show</i> and <i>shew</i>, for instance. It is, perhaps, hardly
  necessary to observe that the sounds <i>k, ch, sh, kh</i> (guttural) are
  commutable. Thus the letter <i>h</i> is named in Italian, <i>acca</i>; in
  French, <i>ache</i>, in English, <i>aitch</i>, perhaps originally
  <i>atch</i>: our <i>church</i> is the Scottish <i>kirk</i>, &amp;c.
  Accordingly, we meet in Shakspeare <i>reckless</i> and <i>rechless</i>,
  <i>reeky</i> and <i>reechy</i>; "As I could <i>pike</i> (pitch) my
  lance." (Coriol., Act I. Sc. 1.) Hall has (<i>Sat</i>. vi. 1.) "Lucan
  <i>streaked</i> (stretched) on his marble bed." So also there were
  <i>like</i> and <i>liche</i>, and the vulgar <i>cham</i> for <i>I am</i>
  (<i>Ic eom</i>, A.-S.)</p>

  <p>Having now to show that both <i>ake</i> and <i>ache</i> were in use, I
  commence with the former:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Like a milch-doe, whose swelling dugs do <i>ake</i>,</p>
      <p>Hasting to find her fawn hid in some brake."</p>
      <p class="i6">Shakspeare's <i>Venus and Adonis</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"By turns now half asleep, now half awake,</p>
      <p>My wounds began to smart, my hurt to <i>ake</i>."</p>
      <p class="i6">Fairfax, <i>Godf. of Bull.</i>, viii, 26.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Yet, ere she went, her vex'd heart, which did <i>ake</i>,</p>
      <p>Somewhat to ease, thus to the king she spake."</p>
      <p class="i6">Drayton, <i>Barons' Wars</i>, iii. 75.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And cramm'd them till their guts did <i>ake</i></p>
      <p>With caudle, custard, and plumcake."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Hudibras</i>, ii. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The following is rather dubious:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If chance once in the spring his head should <i>ach</i>,</p>
      <p>It was foretold: thus says my almanack."</p>
      <p class="i6">Hall, <i>Sat.</i> ii. 7., ed. Singer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The <i>aitch</i>, or rather, as I think, the <i>atch</i> sound, occurs
  in the following places:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>B.</i> Heigh ho!</p>
      <p><i>M.</i> For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?</p>
      <p><i>B.</i> For the letter that begins them all, <i>H</i>."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, Act III. Sc. 4.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Their fears of hostile strokes, their <i>aches</i>, losses."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Timon of Athens</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Yea, fright all <i>aches</i> from your bones."</p>
      <p class="i6">Jonson, <i>Fox</i>, ii. 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
<!-- Page 473 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page473"></a>{473}</span>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wherefore with mine thou dow thy musick match,</p>
      <p>Or hath the crampe thy ionts benom'd with <i>ache</i>."</p>
      <p class="i6">Spenser, <i>Shep. Cal.</i>, viii. 4.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or Gellia wore a velvet mastic-patch</p>
      <p>Upon her temples, when no tooth did <i>ach</i>."</p>
      <p class="i6">Hall, <i>Sat.</i> vi. 1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"As no man of his own self catches</p>
      <p>The itch, or amorous French <i>aches</i>."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Hudibras</i>, ii, 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The natural effect of love,</p>
      <p>As other flames and <i>aches</i> prove."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Ib.</i>, iii. 1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Can by their pangs and <i>aches</i> find</p>
      <p>All turns and changes of the wind."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Ib.</i>, iii. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These, in Butler, are, I believe, the latest instances of this form of
  the word.</p>

  <p>Dear S<sup>r</sup>,</p>

  <p>I heartily thank you for the favour of your letter, and to shew itt
  will not fail to write as often as anything does occurr worth sending, if
  you think the accountt I give not troublesome. Dr. Adams, Dr. Rudston,
  and Delaune have promis'd to write this post: we remembred you both
  before and after your letters came w<sup>th</sup> S<sup>r</sup> John
  Matthews, who staid here 3 nights this weeke. Our militia is gone home
  cloath'd in Blew coates but many coxcombs of this city have refused to
  pay their quota towards the buying of them, railing against my
  L<sup>d</sup> Abington, who has smooth'd the mob by giving a brace of
  Bucks last Friday in Port Meed. J.&nbsp;M. has bin expected here this
  fortnight: the Lady that calls herselfe by his nane has bin a good while
  at Astrop, and has discover'd her displeasure there, that her husband as
  shee calls him keeps the coach so long from her at Oxford: upon hearing
  of w<sup>ch</sup> S<sup>r</sup> W.&nbsp;H. in a blunt way gave her the old
  name, w<sup>ch</sup> caus'd some dissatisfaction and left her smal
  acquaintance: I heare that the understanding between our Friend and his
  uncle is not so good as formerly, but I do not think it will end in
  Abdication. Mr. Painter is admitted Rector of Exeter. The <i>Naked
  Gospel</i><a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> was
  burnt on y<sup>e</sup> 19th in the Scholes Quadrangle. The Regents first
  drew up a Petition to have it censured; then some others more busy than
  wise tooke upon them to gett it subscribed, and went to coffee houses and
  taverns as well as colleges for that purpose: these proceedings being
  ag<sup>st</sup> statute, and reflecting upon the vice ch., gave great
  offence; at last he call'd a meeting of y<sup>e</sup> <!-- Page 474
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page474"></a>{474}</span> heads of
  houses, who deputed 6 to examine it: they pick'd several Proposit.
  w<sup>ch</sup> were read. The sentence was in this form: Propositions
  &amp;<sup>c</sup> tanqu&#x101; falsas et impias in Chris. Relig. et in
  Ecc. præcipue Anglican&#x101; contumeliosas damnamus, plerasq; insuper
  hæreticas esse decernimus et declaramus, &amp;<sup>c</sup>. This was
  first subscribed by all y<sup>e</sup> heads of Coll. and then condemn'd
  unanimously in a full convocation. The Decree is printed, but is too
  large to send. The Author of y<sup>e</sup> Booke has sent about a soft
  vindication of himselfe, that he is unwilling to be accounted a Socinian,
  &amp;c. If I can gett a sight of it I will send you the contents. I do
  not know how far you are in the right about guessing at a Bursar: Tim.
  seems resolv'd to act according to y<sup>e</sup> song; but I to shew good
  nature even w<sup>th</sup>out a tree have promis'd to make him a Dial:
  and when that's done I will doe y<sup>e</sup> like at Astrop. I am</p>

<p class="cenhead">Your very humble serv<sup>t</sup>,<br />
W.&nbsp;R.</p>

  <p>If you see Coll. Byerly, give my service to him.</p>

  <p>Directed thus: These to George Clark, Esq., Secretary of War in

<h3>A SHAKSPERIAN BOOK.</h3>

  <p>"There exists," says Mr. John Wilson, "as it were a talismanic
  influence in regard to the most trivial circumstances connected with
  Shakspeare," and yet this enthusiast has not, in his <i>Shaksperiana</i>,
  alluded to the dramatic works of Mary Hornby, written under, and dated
  from, the <i>dear</i> old roof at Stratford-upon-Avon!</p>

  <p>It was my late good fortune, after filling my pockets from the
  twopenny boxes of the suburban bookstalls, to find, on turning out the
  heterogeneous contents, that I had accidentally become possessed of
  <i>The Broken Vow</i>, a comedy by the aforesaid lady, who waits to be
  enrolled in that much wanted book, a new edition of the <i>Biographia
  Dramatica</i>. This <i>Broken Bow</i> which looks like a re-cooking of
  the <i>Merry Miller</i> of Thomas Sadler, 1766, bears to be "printed at
  Stratford-upon-Avon, for the Author, by W. Barnacle, 1820." Mary Hornby,
  following the example of the <i>preoccupier of the butcher's shop</i>,
  tries her hand at both tragedy and comedy; in the first line she stands
  charged with the perpetration of <i>The Battle of Waterloo</i>, which, I
  doubt not, rivalled its original enactment in its <i>sanguinary</i>
  character. I have not been lucky enough to fall in with this, which was a
  <i>hit</i>; our fair authoress, in her preface to the comedy under
  notice, modestly attributing its great success more to the kindness of
  her friends than to its literary merit.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hornby sustains the dignity of the drama by adhering to her five
  acts, with prologue and epilogue according to prescription. Looking to
  the prologue for the <i>who</i>, the <i>why</i>, and the
  <i>wherefore</i>, I am sorry to say I find no materials for the
  concoction of a biographical note; upon the second point, the <i>why</i>,
  she tells us:</p>

  <p>I leave the reader to judge for himself whether the Muses really "came

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Shakspeare's Monument.</i>&mdash;When I was a young man, some
  thirty or forty years ago, I visited the monument of Shakspeare, in the
  beautiful church of Stratford-upon-Avon, and there copied, from the Album
  which is kept for the names of visitors, the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Stranger! to whom this monument is shown,</p>
      <p>Invoke the poet's curse upon Malone!</p>
      <p>Whose meddling zeal his barbarous taste displays,</p>
      <p>And smears his tombstone, as he marr'd his plays.</p>
      <p class="i16">R. F.</p>
      <p>Oct. 2, 1810."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This has just now been brought to my mind by reading, in page 155. of
  the second volume of Moore's Journal, the following account of a
  conversation at Bowood:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Talked of Malone&mdash;a dull man&mdash;his whitewashing the statue
  of Shakspeare, at Leamington or Stratford (?), and General Fitzpatrick's
  (Lord L.'s uncle) epigram on the subject&mdash;very good&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And smears his statue as he mars his lays.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>I cannot but observe that the doubt expressed in the Diary of
  Moore&mdash;whether Shakspeare's monument is "at Leamington or Stratford
  (?)"&mdash;is curious, and I conceive my version of the last line,
  besides being more correct, is also more pithy. It is incorrect,
  moreover, to call it a <i>statue</i>, as it is a three-quarters bust in a
  niche in the wall.</p>

  <p>The extract from <i>Moore's Diary</i>, however, satisfactorily
  explains the initials "R.&nbsp;F.," which have hitherto puzzled me.</p>

<h3>WALMER CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>In Hasted's <i>History of Kent</i>, vol. iv. p. 172., folio edition,
  we have as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Walmer, probably so called <i>quasi vallum maris</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the wall
  or fortification made against the sea, was expressed to have been a
  member of the port of Sandwich time out of mind," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, p. 165., note <i>m</i>, we find:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Before these three castles were built, there were, between Deal and
  Walmer Castle, two eminences of earth, called 'The Great and Little
  Bulwark;' and another, between the north end of Deal and Sandwich Castle
  (all of which are now remaining): and there was probably one about the
  middle of the town, and others on the spots where the castles were
  erected. They had embrasures for guns, and together formed a defensive
  line of batteries along that part of the coast," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To the new building of these castles Leland alludes, in his <i>Cygnea

<h3>SCOTCHMEN IN POLAND.</h3>

  <p>"He [Sir John Denham] now resided in France, as one of the followers
  of the exiled king; and, to divert <!-- Page 476 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page476"></a>{476}</span> the melancholy of
  their condition, was sometimes enjoined by his master to write occasional
  verses; one of which amusements was probably his ode or song upon the
  Embassy to Poland, by which he and Lord Crofts procured a contribution of
  ten thousand pounds from the Scotch, that wandered over that kingdom.
  Poland was at that time very much frequented by itinerant traders, who,
  in a country of very little commerce and of great extent, where every man
  resided on his own estate, contributed very much to the accommodation of
  life, by bringing to every man's house those little necessaries which it
  was very inconvenient to want, and very troublesome to fetch. I have
  formerly read, without much reflection, of the multitude of Scotchmen
  that travelled with their wares in Poland; and that their numbers were
  not small, the success of this negociation gives sufficient
  evidence."</p>

<h3>BISHOP JUXON AND WALTON'S POLYGLOTT BIBLE.</h3>

  <p>In the library at this island, which formerly belonged to the Knights
  of Malta, there is an edition of Walton's Polyglott Bible, which was
  published in London in 1657. This work is in a most perfect state of
  preservation.</p>

  <p>On the title-page of the first of the eleven volumes, there is
  written, in a bold and perfectly legible manner, the following words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Liber Coll. Di Joannis Bapt<sup>a</sup> Oxon Ex dono Reverendiss. in
  Xt<sup>o</sup> Patris Gvil<sup>i</sup> Jvxon Archiep. Cantvariensis.
  A<sup>o</sup> D<sup>ni</sup> 1663."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Just below, but on the right of the above, there is written in a clear
  hand as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ex Libris domus Abbatialis S. Antonij Viennensis, Catalogo Inscript
  an. 1740. No. 11."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That the question which I shall ask at the end of this Note may be the
  more easily answered, it will perhaps be necessary for me to state, that
  in the year 1777, Rohan, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta,
  succeeded in annexing the property belonging to the Order of St. Antonio
  de Vienna to that of Malta. In accepting of these estates, which were
  situated in France and Savoy, Rohan bound himself to pay the many
  mortgages and debts with which they were encumbered; and so large an
  amount had to be thus defrayed, that for a hundred years the convent
  would not be reimbursed for its advances, and receive the 120,000 livres,
  at which sum their annual rental would then be valued. Of the foundation
  of this Order a recent writer (Thornton) thus remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In 1095 some nobles of Dauphiny united for the relief of sufferers
  from a kind of leprosy called St. Anthony's fire, which society, in 1218,
  was erected into a religious body of Hospitallers, having a grand master
  for chief. This order, after many changes in its constitution, having
  been left the option between extinction and secularisation, or union with
  another order, accepted the latter alternative, and selected that of St.
  John of Jerusalem."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among the moveable effects which came to the Knights of Malta by this
  arrangement, was a small and well-selected library, and in it this
  edition of Walton's Bible.</p>

  <p>Without, therefore, writing more at length on this subject, which
  might take up too much space in "N. &amp; Q.," I would simply add, that
  my attention was called to this work by the Rev. Mr. Howe, chaplain of
  H.B.M. ship "Britannia," and for the purpose of asking, At what time, by
  whom, and in what manner, were these volumes removed from St. John's
  College at Oxford, and transferred to the library of the Order of St.
  Antonio de Vienna in France?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Was Andrew Marvell poisoned?</i>&mdash;I have just been reading the
  three ponderous quarto volumes comprising <i>The Works</i> of Andrew
  Marvell, as collected and edited by his townsman, Capt. Edward Thompson
  of Hull. In the "Life," near the end of vol. iii., we are told that the
  patriot died on Aug. 16, 1678, "and by poison for he was healthful and
  vigorous to the moment he was seized with the premeditated ruin." And
  again, in a summary of his merits, we are told that "all these patriot
  virtues were insufficient to guard him against the jesuitical
  machinations of the <i>state</i>; for what vice and bribery could not
  influence, was perpetrated by poison." This heinous crime, so formally
  averred against the enemies of Marvell, may have been committed by "some
  person or persons unknown;" but, as not a tittle of evidence is adduced
  or indicated by the zealous biographer in support of the
  charge&mdash;Query, had it any foundation in fact? In the court, and out
  of the court, the anti-popish, anti-prelatical Puritan had enemies
  numerous and bitter enough; but is there really any other ground for the
  abominable imputation of foul play alluded to, beyond his actually sudden
  death? Is the hypothesis of poison coeval with the date of Marvell's
  demise? If so, was there any official inquiry&mdash;any "crowner's
  quest?" Surely his admiring compatriots on the banks of the Humber did
  not at once quietly sit down with the conviction, that <i>thus</i> "fell
  one of the first characters of this kingdom or of any other."</p>

  <p><i>Purlieu.</i>&mdash;Some of your correspondents seem afraid that an

  Could <i>this</i>, at least, not be done without much objection? Could we
  not co-operate in finding the earliest known mention of words, and thus
  perhaps trace the occasion and manner of their introduction?</p>

  <p>At any rate, this word <i>purlieu</i> is certainly in want of some
  examination. Johnson has adopted the wretched etymology of <i>pur</i>,
  Fr. for pure, and <i>lieu</i>, Fr. for place; and he defines it as a
  place on the outskirts of a forest free of wood.</p>

  <p>The earliest record in which this word occurs, so far as I have seen,
  is in an act of Edward III., quoted by Manwood, and it is there spelt
  <i>puraley</i>; and it relates to the disafforested parts which several
  preceding kings permitted to be detached from their royal forests.</p>

  <p>Might I ask if any of your correspondents find an earlier use of the
  word; and can it be gifted with a probable paternity?</p>

  <p>The tracing of the earliest known mention of disputed words is a task
  capable of being finished, and might perhaps be attended, in many cases,
  with happy results. It would rid us probably of many puerilities which
  degrade our current dictionaries.</p>

  <p><i>Autobiographical Sketch.</i>&mdash;A fragment came into my

  desirous to trace to the book of which it forms a part, but my research
  has hitherto proved unsuccessful. It consists of two leaves of a large
  octavo sheet, probably published some twenty years back, and is headed
  "Autobiographical Sketch of the Editor." It commences with the words:
  "The Commissioners of the Poor Laws will understand me, when I say, that
  I was born at Putney, in Surrey." The pages are of course not
  consecutive: so after an allusion to the wanderings of the writer, I have
  nothing more up to p. 7., at which is an account of a supposed plot
  against the lord mayor and sheriffs, concocted by him with the assistance
  of some school-boy coadjutors; the object of which appears to have been,
  to overturn the state-coach of the civic functionary, as it ascended
  Holborn Hill, by charging it with a hackney coach, in which sat the
  writer and certain widows armed with bolsters in pink satin bags. The
  word having been given to "Charge!" this new kind of war-chariot was
  driven down the hill at full speed, gunpowder ignited on its roof, and
  blazing squibs protruded <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>There is a Booth Hall in Blackley, a small village lying by the road

  Adamson, principal of the college at Edinburgh, and editor of the
  <i>Muses' Welcome</i>; and whether any existing family claims to be
  descended from them? They were all born at Perth. Henry and John were the
  sons of James Adamson, a merchant and magistrate of the fair city.
  Probably the archbishop was a brother of this James Adamson, and son of
  Patrick Adamson, who was Dean of the Guild when John Knox preached his
  famous sermon at St. John's. Mariota, a daughter of the archbishop, is
  said by Burke to have married Sir Michael <!-- Page 479 --><span

  Nortland Castle Orkney. Another daughter would appear to have become the
  wife of Thomas Wilson, or Volusenus, as he calls himself, the editor of
  his father-in-law's poems and other publications.</p>

<h3>PSALMANAZAR.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 206. 435.)</p>

  <p>Having long felt a great respect for this person, and a great interest
  in all that concerns his history, I am induced to mention the grounds on
  which I have been led to doubt whether the letter in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i>, to which <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> refers, is
  worthy of credit. When I first saw it, I considered it as so valuable an
  addition to the information which I had collected on the subject, that I
  was anxious to know who was the writer. It had no signature; but the
  date, "Sherdington, June, 1704," which was retained, gave me a clue
  which, by means not worth detailing, led me to the knowledge that what
  thus appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for February, 1765, had
  issued from "Curll's chaste press" more than thirty years before, in the
  form of a letter from the person now known in literary history as
  "Curll's Corinna," but by her cotemporaries (see the index of Mr.
  Cunningham's excellent <i>Handbook of London</i>) as Mrs. Elizabeth
  Thomas, sometime of Dyot Street, St. Giles's, and afterwards of a
  locality not precisely ascertained, but within the rules of the Fleet,
  and possibly (though Mr. Cunningham does not corroborate this) at some
  period of her life resident in the more genteel quarters which Curll
  assigns to her. To speak more strictly, and make the matter intelligible
  to any one who may look at it in the Magazine, I should add that the
  first paragraph (seventeen lines, on p. 78., dated from "Sherdington,"
  and beginning "I dined," says the letter writer, "last Saturday with Sir
  John Guise, at Gloucester") is part of a letter purporting to be written
  by her lover; while all the remainder (on pp. 79-81.) is from Corinna's
  answer to it.</p>

  <p>The worthless and forgotten work of which these letters form a part,
  consists of two volumes. The copy which I borrowed when I discovered what
  I have stated, consisted of a first volume of the second edition (1736),
  and a second volume of the first edition (1732). The title of the second
  volume (which I give as belonging to the earlier edition) is:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Honourable Lovers: or, the second and last Volume of Pylades and
  Corinna. Being the remainder of Love Letters, and other Pieces (in Verse
  and Prose), which passed between Richard Gwinnett, Esq.; of Great
  Shurdington, in Gloucestershire, and Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, Jun., of
  Great Russel Street, Bloomsbury. To which is added, a Collection of
  familiar Letters between Corinna, Mr. Norris, Capt. Hemington, Lady
  Chudleigh, Lady Pakington, &amp;c. &amp;c. All faithfully published from
  their original Manuscripts. London: printed in the Year <span
  class="scac">M.DCC.XXXII.</span> (Price 5<i>s.</i>)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The title-page of the first volume (second edition) differs
  principally in having the statement that the book was "printed for E.
  Curll" (whose name does not appear in the earlier second volume, though
  perhaps it may have done so in the first of that earlier edition), and an
  announcement that the fidelity of the publication is "attested, by Sir
  Edward Northey, Knight."</p>

  <p>The work is a farrago of low rubbish utterly beneath criticism; and I
  should perhaps hardly think it worth while to say as much as I have said
  of it, had it not been that, in turning it about, I could not help
  feeling a suspicion that Daniel Defoe's hand was in the matter, at least
  so far as that papers that had belonged to him might have come into
  Curll's hands, and furnished materials for the work. It would be tedious
  to enter into details; but the question seemed to me to be one of some
  interest, because, in my own mind, it was immediately followed by
  another, namely, whether Daniel had not more to do than has been
  suspected with the <i>History of Formosa</i>? Those who are more familiar
  with Defoe than I am, will be better able to judge whether he was, as
  Psalmanazar says, "the person who Englished it from my Latin;" for the
  youth was as much disqualified for writing the book in English, by being
  a Frenchman, as he would have been if he had been a Formosan. He
  acknowledges that this person assisted him to correct improbabilities;
  but I do not know that he anywhere throws further light on the question
  respecting the help which he must have had. Daniel would be just the man
  to correct some gross improbabilities, and at the same time help him to
  some more probable fictions. Under this impression I recently inquired
  (see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 305.) respecting the authorship of <!--
  Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page480"></a>{480}</span>
  <i>Pylades and Corinna</i>, and the possibility that it might be the work
  of Defoe; but I believe that my question has not been answered.</p>

  <p>I have already trespassed unreasonably on your columns; but still I
  must beg, in justice to a man whose character, as I have said, I very
  highly respect, to add one remark. When his imposture is referred to, it
  is not always remembered that when he came to this country he was not his
  own master. It seems that he rambled away from his home in the South of
  France, when about fifteen years old; that he spent about two years in
  wandering about France and Germany, and astonishing people by pretending
  to be, at first a converted, and afterwards an unconverted, Formosan;
  that when performing this second, pagan, character, he arrived at Sluys,
  where a Scotch regiment in the Dutch service, under Brigadier Lauder, was
  stationed; that the chaplain, named Innes, detected the fraud, but
  instead of reproving the lad for his sin and folly, only considered how
  he might turn the cheat to his own advantage, and render it conducive to
  his own preferment. The abandoned miscreant actually went through the
  blasphemous mockery of baptizing the youth as a convert from heathenism;
  named him after the brigadier, who stood godfather: claimed credit from
  the Bishop of London for his zeal; and was by the kind prelate invited to
  bring his convert to London. The chaplain lost no time in accepting, was
  graciously received by the bishop and the archbishop, snapped up the
  first piece of preferment that would answer his views (it happened to be
  the office of chaplain-general to the forces in Portugal), and made off,
  leaving his convert to bear the storm which was sure to burst on him, as
  best he might. That a youth thus tutored and thus abandoned, before
  Johnson was born, should have lived to attract his society, and win from
  him the testimony that he was "the best man" whom he had ever known,
  gives him a claim to our respect, which seems to me to be strengthened by
  everything which I have been able to learn respecting him.</p>

<h3>CONSECRATED ROSES, ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 407.)</p>

  <p>Had G.'s Query referred solely to the consecration of <i>The Golden
  Rose</i>, I might have given him a satisfactory answer by referring him
  to Cartari's essay on the subject entitled <i>La Rosa d'Ora Pontificia,
  &amp;c.</i>, 4to. 1681, and to the account (with accompanying engraving)
  of the <i>Rose, Sword, and Cap</i> consecrated by Julius III., and sent
  by him to Philip and Mary; and to Cardinal Pole's exposition of these
  Papal gifts, which are to be found in the 1st volume of F. Angeli Rocca,
  <i>Opera Omnia</i> (fol. Rome, 1719). In the authors to whom I have
  referred, much curious information will, however, be found. I take this
  opportunity of saying, that as I am about to submit a communication on
  the subject of <i>The Golden Rose</i> to the Society of Antiquaries, I
  shall feel obliged by any hints which may help me to render it more
  complete; and of putting on record in "N. &amp; Q." the following
  particulars of the ceremonial, as it was performed on the 6th of March
  last, which I extract from the <i>Dublin Weekly Telegraph</i> of the 9th
  of April.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"On Sunday, the 6th [March, 1853], the Benediction of the Golden Rose,
  was, according to annual usage, performed by the Pontiff previously to
  High Mass, in the Sistine Chapel, celebrated by a cardinal, at which he
  assists every Sunday during Lent. To the more ancient practice of
  blessing, on the fourth Sunday of 'Quaresima,' a pair of gold and silver
  keys, touched with filings from the chains of St. Peter (which are still
  preserved in Rome), the Holy See has substituted that of the Benediction
  of the 'Rosa d'Oro,' to be presented, within the year, to some sovereign
  or other potentate, who has proved well deserving of the Church. The
  first positive record respecting the Golden Rose has been ascribed to the
  Pontificate of Leo IX. (1049-53); but a writer in the <i>Civitta
  Catolica</i> states that allusion to a census levied for its cost may be
  found in the annals of a still earlier period. The Pontiffs used formerly
  to present it annually to the Prefect of Rome, after singing Mass, on
  this Sunday, at the Lateran, and pronouncing a homily, during which they
  lifted the consecrated object in one hand whilst expounding to the people
  its mystic significance. Pius II. (1458) is the last Pope recorded to
  have thus preached in reference to and thus conferred the Golden Rose;
  and the first foreign potentate recorded to have received it from the
  Holy See is Fulk, Count of Anjou, to whom it was presented by Urban II.
  in 1096. A homily of Innocent III. also contains all explanation of this
  beautiful symbol&mdash;the precious metal, the balsam and musk used in
  consecrating it, being taken in mystic sense as allusion to the triple
  substance in the person of the Incarnate Lord&mdash;divinity, soul, and
  body. It is not merely a single flower, but an entire rose-tree that is
  represented&mdash;the whole about a foot in height, most delicately
  wrought in fine lamina of gold. This being previously deposited between
  lighted candelabra, on a table in the sacristy, is taken by the youngest
  cleric of the camera, to be consigned to his Holiness, after the latter
  has been vested for the solemnity, but before his assuming the mitre.
  After a beautiful form of prayer, with incense and holy water, the
  Pontiff then, holding the object in his hand, imparts the Benediction,
  introducing into the flower which crowns the graceful stem, and is
  perforated so as to provide a receptacle, balsam of Peru and powder of
  musk. He then passes with the usual procession into the Sistine, still
  carrying the rose in his left hand; and during the Mass it remains
  beneath the crucifix over the altar. If in the course of the year no
  donation of the precious object is thought advisable, the same is
  consecrated afresh on the anniversary following. Some have conjectured
  that the Empress of France will be selected <!-- Page 481 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page481"></a>{481}</span> by Pius IX. to receive
  this honour in the present instance; but this is mere conjecture. On a
  former occasion, it is true, the Golden Rose was conferred by him on
  another crowned head of the fairer sex&mdash;one entitled to more than
  common regards from the Supreme Pastor in adversity&mdash;the Queen of
  Naples."</p>

<h3>CAMPBELL'S IMITATIONS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 505.)</p>

  <p>It is curious that two of the passages pointed out by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Breen</span>, as containing borrowed ideas, are those
  quoted by Alison in his recent volume (<i>Hist. Eur.</i>, vol. i. pp.

<h3>"THE HANOVER RAT."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii. p. 206.)</p>

  <p><i>An Essay on Irish Bulls</i> is said to have found its way into a
  catalogue of works upon natural history; with which precedent in my
  favour, and pending the inquiries of <i>naturalists</i>,
  <i>ratcatchers</i>, and <i>farmers</i> into the history of the
  above-named formidable invader, I hope <span class="sc">Mr.
  Hibberd</span> will have no objection to my intruding a bibliographical
  curiosity under the convenient head he has opened for it in "N. &amp;
  Q."</p>

  <p>My book, then, bears the appropriate title, <i>An Attempt towards a
  Natural History of the Hanover Rat, dedicated to P***m M******r, M.D.,
  and S&mdash;&mdash;y to the Royal Society</i>, 8vo., pp. 24.: London,
  1744.</p>

  <p>The writer of this curious piece takes his <i>cue</i> from that
  remarkable production, <i>An Attempt towards a Natural History of the
  Polype</i>, 1743; in which the learned Mr. Henry Baker, in a letter to
  Martin Folkes, of 218 pages, 8vo., illustrated by a profusion of
  woodcuts, elaborately describes this link between the animal and
  vegetable creation, and the experiments he practised upon the same:
  commencing with "cutting off a polype's head," and so on through a series
  of scientific barbarities upon his <i>little creature</i>, which ended
  only in "turning a polype inside out!"</p>

  <p>Following the plan of Mr. Baker, the anonymous author of <i>The
  Hanover Rat</i> tells us, that, after thirty years' laborious research,
  he had <!-- Page 482 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page482"></a>{482}</span> satisfied himself that this animal was
  not a native of these islands: "I cannot," he says, "particularly mark
  the date of its first appearance, yet I think it is within the memory of
  man;" and finding favour in its original <i>mine affamée</i> state with a
  few of the most starved and hungry of the English rats from the common
  sewer, he proceeds to show that it <i>did</i> extirpate the natives; but
  whether this is the best account, or whether the facts of the case as
  here set forth will satisfy your correspondent, is another thing.
  According to <i>my</i> authority, the aboriginal rat was, at the period
  of writing, sorely put to it to maintain his ground against the invading
  colonists and their unnatural allies the <i>providers</i>; and the
  present work seems to have been an effort on the part of one in the
  interest of the former to awaken them to a sense of their danger. In his
  laudable attempts to rally their courage, this advocate reminds them of a
  similar crisis when their country was infested with a species of frog
  called <i>Dutch frogs</i>: "which no sooner," says he, "began to be
  mischievous, than its growth and progress was stopped by the natives."
  "Had we," he continues, "but the same public spirit with our ancestors,
  we need not complain to-day of being eaten up by <i>rats</i>. Our country
  is the same, but alas! we feel no more the same affection for it." In
  this way he stimulates the invaded to a combined attack upon the common
  enemy, and we need not tell <i>our</i> readers how successfully, nor how
  desperate the struggle, the very next year; which ended in the complete
  ascendancy of the <i>Hanover rat</i>, or reigning family, over the
  unlucky Jacobite native. Under his figure of a rat, this Jacobite is very
  scurrilous indeed upon the Hanoverian succession; and, continuing his
  <i>polypian</i> imitations, relates a few coarse experiments upon <i>his
  subject</i> illustrative of its destructive properties, voracity, and
  sagacity, which set at nought "all the contrivances of the farmer to
  defend his barns; the trailer his warehouse; the gentleman his land; or
  the inferior people their cup-boards and small beer cellars. No bars or
  bolts can keep them out, nor can any gin or trap lay hold of them."</p>

  <p>Luckily for us living in these latter days, we can extract amusement
  from topics of this nature, which would have subjected our forefathers to
  severe pains and penalties; and looking at the character and mischievous
  tendency of <i>The Hanover Rat</i>, I am curious to know if Mary Cooper,
  the publisher, was put under surveillance for her share in its
  production; for to me it appears a more aggravated libel upon the
  reigning family than that of the <i>Norfolk Prophecy</i>&mdash;for the
  publication of which, Boswell says, the great Samuel Johnson had to play
  at hide and seek with the officers of justice.</p>

  <p>The advent of both Pretenders was preceded by <i>straws</i> like these
  cast out by their adherents, to try <i>how the current set</i>. The
  present <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, however, is a double-shotted one: for, not
  content with tampering with the public allegiance, this aboriginal rat
  seems more innocently enjoying a laugh at the Royal Society, and its
  ingenious <i>fellow</i> Mr. Baker, in as far as regards the aforesaid
  elaborate treatise upon <i>polypes</i>.</p>

<h3>FONT INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 408.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span> desires examples of these. I can
  supply the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>At Bradley, Lincolnshire, is a very large font, of the Decorated
  period, with this inscription round the bowl in black letter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Pater Noster, Ave Maria, and Criede, leren ye chyld yt es nede."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is an early instance of the use of <i>English</i> for
  inscriptions. The sketch was engraved in the work on <i>Baptismal
  Fonts</i>.</p>

  <p>At Threckingham, Lincolnshire, I believe I succeeded in deciphering an
  inscription round the font, which was said to have been previously
  studied in vain. It is somewhat defaced; but in all probability the words
  are,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ave Maria gracia p... d... t..."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of course, "plena, dominus tecum." The bowl of the font
  is Early English; but the base, round which the inscription runs, appears
  to be of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>At Burgate, Suffolk, an inscription in black letter is incised on the
  upper step of the font:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"[Orate pro an&mdash;b'] Will'mi Burgate militis et d<span
  class="over">n</span>e Elionore uxoris eius qui istum fontem fieri
  fecerunt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir William Burgate died in 1409. It is engraved in the <i>Proceedings
  of the Bury and West Suffolk Archæological Institute</i>.</p>

  <p>At Caistor, by Norwich:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Orate pro animab ... liis ... ici de Castre."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At Walsoken, Norfolk:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Remember the soul of S. Honyter and Margaret his wife, and John
  Beforth, Chaplain."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>with the date 1544.</p>

  <p>At Gaywood, Norfolk, is a font of Gothic design, lust probably of
  post-Reformation date. On four of the eight sides of the bowl are these
  inscriptions:</p>

<h3>IRISH RHYMES&mdash;ENGLISH PROVINCIALISMS&mdash;LOWLAND SCOTCH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., pp. 605, 606.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Bede</span>, who first called attention to a
  class of rhymes which he denominated "Irish," seems to take it ill that I
  have dealt with his observations as somewhat "hypercritical." I
  acknowledge the justness of his criticism; but I did, and must still,
  demur to the propriety of calling certain false rhymes peculiarly
  <i>Irish</i>, when I am able to produce similes from poets of celebrity,
  who cannot stand excused by <span class="sc">Mr. Bede's</span>
  explanation, that the rhymes in question "made music for their Irish
  ear." If, as he tells us, <span class="sc">Mr. Bede</span> was not "blind
  to similar imperfections in English poets," I am yet to learn why he
  should fix on "Swift's Irishisms," and call those errors a national
  peculiarity, when he finds them so freely scattered through the standard
  poetry of England?</p>

  <p>Your correspondent J. H. T. suggests a new direction for inquiry on
  this subject when he conjectures that the pronunciation now called
  <i>Irish</i> was, "during the first half of the eighteenth century, the
  received pronunciation of the most correct speakers of the day;" and
  <span class="sc">Mr. Bede</span> himself suggests that
  <i>provincialisms</i> may sometimes modify the rhymes of even so correct
  a versifier as Tennyson. I hope some of your contributors will have
  "drunk so deep of the well of English undefiled" as to be competent to
  address themselves to this point of inquiry. I cannot pretend to do much,
  being but a shallow philologist; yet, since I received your last Number,
  I have lighted on a passage in that volume of "omnifarious information"
  Croker's <i>Boswell</i>, which will not be deemed inapplicable.</p>

  <p>Boswell, during a sojourn at Lichfield in 1776, expressed a doubt as
  to the correctness of Johnson's eulogy on his townsmen, as "speaking the
  purest English," and instanced several provincial sounds, such as
  <i>there</i> pronounced like <i>fear</i>, <i>once</i> like <i>woonse</i>.
  On this passage are a succession of notes: Burney observes, that "David
  Garrick always said <i>shupreme, shuperior</i>." Malone's note brings the
  case in point to ours when he says, "This is still the vulgar
  pronunciation in Ireland; the pronunciation in Ireland is doubtless that
  which generally prevailed in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth." And
  Mr. Croker sums up the case thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"No doubt the English settlers carried over, and may have in some
  cases preserved, the English idiom and accent of their day. Bishop
  Kearny, as well as his friend Mr. Malone, thought that the most
  remarkable peculiarity of Irish pronunciation, as in <i>say</i> for
  <i>sea</i>, <i>tay</i> for <i>tea</i>, was <i>the English mode, even down
  to the reign of Queen Anne</i>; and there are rhymes in Pope, and more
  frequently in Dryden, that countenance that opinion. But rhymes cannot be
  depended upon for minute identity of sound."&mdash;Croker's <i>Notes</i>,
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1776.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If this explanation be adopted, it will account for the examples I
  have been furnishing, and others which I find even among the harmonious
  rhymes of Spenser (he might, however, have caught the brogue in Ireland);
  yet am I free to own that to me popular pronunciation scarcely justifies
  the committing to paper such loose rhymes as ought to grate on that
  fineness of ear which is an essential faculty in the true poet; "here or
  awa'," in England or Ireland, I continue to set them down to "slip-slop
  composition."</p>

  <p>It may not be inappropriate to notice, that among Swift's
  eccentricities, we find a propensity to "out-of-the-way rhymes." In his
  works are numerous examples of couplets made apparently for no other
  purpose but to show that no word could baffle him; and the anecdote of
  his long research for a rhyme for the name of his old enemy Serjent
  <i>Betsworth</i>, and of the curious accident by which he obtained it, is
  well known; from which we may conclude that he was on the watch for
  occasions of exhibiting such rhymes as <i>rakewell</i> and <i>sequel</i>,
  <i>charge ye</i> and <i>clergy</i>, without supposing him ignorant that
  he was guilty of "lèse majesté" against the laws of correct
  pronunciation.</p>

  <p>When I asked <span class="sc">Mr. Bede's</span> decision on a
  <i>palpable Cockneyism</i> in verse, I did so merely with a view, by a
  "<i>tu quoque</i> pleasantry," to enliven a discussion, which I hope we
  may carry on and conclude in that good humour with which I accept his
  parenthetic hint, that I have made "a bull" of my Pegasus. I beg to
  submit to him, that, as I read the <i>Classical Dictionary</i>, it is
  from the <i>heels</i> of Pegasus the fount of poetic inspiration is
  supposed to be derived; and, further, that the <i>brogue</i> is not so
  <i>malapropos</i> to the <i>heel</i> as he imagines, for in Ireland the
  <i>brogue</i> is in use as well to cover the <i>understanding</i> as to
  <i>tip the tongue</i>. Could I enjoy the pleasure of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Bede's</span> company in a stroll over my native mountains, he might find
  that there are occasions on which he might be glad to put off <!-- Page
  484 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484"></a>{484}</span> his
  London-made shoe, and "to <i>wear</i> the <i>brogue</i>, though
  <i>speak</i> none."</p>

  <p class="author">A. B. R.

  <p>P.S.&mdash;The <i>postscriptum</i> of J. H. T. respecting the
  pronunciation of English being preserved in Scotland, goes direct to an
  opinion I long since formed, that the Lowland Scotch, as we read it in
  the Waverley Novels, is the only genuine unadulterated remains we have of
  the Saxon language, as used before the Norman Conquest. I formed this
  opinion from continually tracing what we call "braid Scotch" to its root,
  in Bosworth's, and other Saxon dictionaries; and I lately found this fact
  confirmed and accounted for in a passage of Verstegan, as
  follows:&mdash;He tells us that after the battle of Hastings Prince Edgar
  Atheling, with his sisters Margaret and Christian, retired into Scotland,
  where King Malcolm married the former of these ladies; and proceeds
  thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"As now the English court, by reason of the aboundance of Normannes
  therein, became moste to speak French, so the Scottish court, because of
  the queen, and the many English that came with her, began to speak
  English; the which language, it would seem, King Malcolm himself had
  before that learned, and now, by reason of his queen, did more affecte
  it. But the English toung, in fine, prevailed more in Scotland than the
  French did in England; <i>for English became the language of all the
  south part of Scotland</i>, the Irish (or Gaelic) having before that been
  the general language of the whole country, since remaining only in the
  north."&mdash;Verstegan's <i>Restitution of Antiquities</i>, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1605.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Many of your accomplished philological readers will doubtless consider
  the information of this Note trivial and puerile; but they will, I hope,
  bear with a tyro in the science, in recording an original remark of his
  own, borne out by an authority so decisive as Verstegan.</p>

<h3>PICTURES BY HOGARTH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 339. 412.)</p>

  <p>In reply to <span class="sc">Amateur</span>, I can inform him that at
  the sale of the Marlborough effects at Marlborough House about thirty
  years ago, there were sold four or five small whole-lengths in oil of
  members of that family. They were hardly clever enough for what Hogarth's
  after-style would lead us to expect, but there were many reasons for
  thinking they were by him. They came into the possession of Mr. Croker,
  who presented them, as family curiosities, to the second Earl Spencer,
  and they are now, I presume, in the gallery at Althorpe. One of them was
  peculiarly curious as connected with a remarkable anecdote of the great
  Duchess. Horace Walpole tells us in the <i>Reminiscences</i>, her
  granddaughter, Lady Bateman, having persuaded her brother, the young Duke
  of Marlborough, to marry a Miss Trevor without the Duchess's consent:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The grandam's rage exceeded all bounds. Having a portrait of Lady
  Bateman, she blackened the face, and then wrote on it, '<i>Now her
  outside's as black as her inside.</i>'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One of the portraits I speak of was of Lady Bateman, and bore on its
  face evidence of having incurred some damage, for the coat of arms with
  which (like all the others, and as was Hogarth's fashion) it was
  ornamented in one corner, were angrily scratched out, as with a knife.
  Whether this defacement gave rise to Walpole's story, or whether the face
  had been also blackened with some stuff that was afterwards removed,
  seems doubtful; the picture itself, according to my recollection, showed
  no mark but the armorial defacement.</p>

  <p>I much wonder this style of small whole-lengths has not been more
  prevalent; they give the general air and manner of the personage so much
  better than the bust size can do, and they are so much more suited to the
  size of our ordinary apartments.</p>

  <p class="author">C.

  <p>Referring to <span class="sc">An Amateur's</span> inquiry as to where
  any pictures painted by Hogarth are to be seen, I beg to say that I have
  in my possession, and should be happy to show him, the portrait of
  Hogarth's wife (Sir William Thornhill's daughter), painted by
  himself.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Lyndon Rolls</span>.

  <p class="address">Banbury.

  <p>The late Bishop Luscombe showed me, at Paris, in 1835, a picture of
  "The Oratorio,"&mdash;a subject well known from Hogarth's etching. He
  told me that he bought it at a broker's shop in the Rue St. Denis; that,
  on examination, he found the frame to be English; and that, as the price
  was small&mdash;thirty francs, if I remember rightly&mdash;he bought the
  piece, without supposing it to be more than a copy. Sir William Knighton,
  on seeing it in the bishop's collection, told him that Hogarth's original
  had belonged to the Dukes of Richmond, and had been in their residence at
  Paris until the first Revolution, since which time it had not been heard
  of; and Sir William had no doubt that the bishop had been so fortunate as
  to recover it. Perhaps some of your readers may have something to say on
  this story.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Washing Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;In "N. &amp; Q.," No. 153., p.
  320., your valued correspondent <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>
  states "that up to the <i>final</i> period of the operation, no washing
  of the plate is requisite. It prevents, rather than assists, the
  necessary chemical action.".</p>

  <p>Now, in all other instructions I have yet seen, it is directed to wash
  off the iron, or other developing solution, <i>prior</i> to immersing in
  the hypo., and after <!-- Page 485 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page485"></a>{485}</span> such immersion, again to wash well in
  water. I shall feel greatly obliged if <span class="sc">Dr.</span> D.
  will be kind enough to state whether the first-named washing is
  requisite, or whether the properties of the hypo., or the beauty of the
  picture, will be in any way injured by the previous solutions <i>not</i>
  having been washed off, prior to the fixings.</p>

  <p class="author">C. W.

<div class="note">
  <p>[We have submitted this Query to <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>,
  who informs us that he never adopts the practice of washing off the
  developing fluid, and considers it not only needless, but sometimes
  prejudicial, as when such washing has not been resorted to, the
  hyposulphite solution flows more readily over the picture, and causes
  none of the unpleasant stains which frequently occur in pictures which
  have been previously washed, especially if hard water has been used. But
  besides this, and the saving of time, the doing away with this
  unnecessary washing economises water, which in out-door practice is often
  a great consideration. <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> would again
  impress upon our readers the advantage of using the hyposulphite over and
  over again, merely keeping up its full strength by the addition of fresh
  crystals of the salt from time to time, as such practice produces
  pictures of whiter and softer tone than are ever produced by the raw
  solution.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Colouring Collodion Pictures</i> (Vol. vii., p. 388.)&mdash;A
  patent has just been taken out (dated September 23, 1852) for this
  purpose, by Mons. J.&nbsp;L. Tardieu, of Paris. He terms his process
  <i>tardiochromy</i>. It consists in applying oil or other colours at the
  back of the pictures, so as to give the requisite tints to the several
  parts of the photograph, without at all interfering with its extreme
  delicacy. It may even, in some cases, be used to remedy defects in the
  photographic picture. The claim is essentially for the application of
  colours at the back, instead of on the surface of photographs, whatever
  kind of colours may be used. It is therefore, of course, applicable only
  to photographs taken on paper, glass, or some transparent material.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A. C. Wilson</span>.

  <p><i>Wanted, a simple Test for a good Lens.</i>&mdash;As all writers on
  Photography agree that the first great essential for successful practice
  is a good lens&mdash;that is to say, a lens of which the visual and
  chemical foci coincide&mdash;can any of the scientific readers of "N.
  &amp; Q." point out any simple test by which unscientific parties
  desirous of practising photography may be enabled to judge of the
  goodness of a lens? A country gentleman, like myself, may purchase a lens
  from an eminent house, with an assurance that it is everything that can
  be desired (and I am <i>not</i> putting an imaginary case), and may
  succeed in getting beautiful images upon his focussing-glass, but very
  unsatisfactory pictures; and it may not be until he has almost abandoned
  photography, in despair at his own want of skill, that he has the
  opportunity of showing his apparatus, manipulation, &amp;c. to some more
  practised hand, who is enabled to prove that <i>the lens was not
  capable</i> of doing what the vendors stated it could do. Surely
  scientific men must know of a simple test which would save the
  disappointment I have described; and I hope some one will take pity upon
  me, and send it to "N. &amp; Q.," for the benefit of myself and every
  other</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Tent&mdash;Restoration of Faded
  Negatives.</i>&mdash;In Vol. vii., p. 462., I find M.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;M. inquiring for
  a cheap and portable tent, effective for photographic operations out of
  doors. I have for the last two years, and in mid-day (June), prepared
  calotype paper, and also the collodion glass plates, for the camera,
  under a tent of glazed yellow calico of only a single thickness: the
  light admitted is very great, but does not in the least injure the most
  sensitive plate or paper. It is made square like a large bag, so that in
  a room I can use it double as a blind; and out of doors, in a high wind,
  I have crept into it, and prepared my paper opposite the object I
  intended to calotype.</p>

  <p>I should be glad it any of your readers would inform me how a failed
  negative calotype can be restored to its original strength. I last year
  took a great number, some of which have nearly faded away; and others are
  as strong, and as able to be used to print from, as when first done. The
  paper was prepared with the single iodide of silver solution, and
  rendered sensitive with aceto-nitrate sil. and gallic acid in the usual
  way. I attribute the fading to the hyposulphate not being got rid of; and
  the question is, Can the picture he restored?</p>

  <p><i>Wives of Ecclesiastics</i> (Vol. i., p. 115.).&mdash;In considering

  interdicting the marriage of ecclesiastics, might it not be worth
  investigating, by such of your correspondents as are curious on the
  subject, what had been the antecedents of the several bishops
  themselves?</p>

  <p>With respect to Thomas II., Archbishop of York, it is historically
  certain, that he was the <i>son</i> of an ecclesiastic, and likewise the
  <i>grandson</i> of an ecclesiastic (his <i>father</i> being one of the
  bishops who concurred in these statutes). Neither does it seem altogether
  unlikely that Thomas himself also had spent some part of his early life
  in bonds of wedlock, since we learn from the <i>Monasticon</i> (vol. iii.
  p. 490. of new edit.), that "Thomas, <i>son of Thomas</i> (<i>the second
  of that name</i>), <i>Archbishop of York</i>, confirmed what his
  predecessors, Thomas and Girard, had given," &amp;c. If this be correct,
  as stated<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, the
  conclusion is inevitable; but possibly some error may have arisen out of

  fifty years ago, from one of the sisters of the late Sir Henry Goodricke,
  the last of the family who possessed Ribston. Though it leaves the
  question concerning the origin of that excellent apple unsettled, yet it
  may not be uninteresting to <!-- Page 487 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="cenhead">"<i>Tradition of the Ribston Pippin Tree.</i></p>

  <p>"About the beginning of the last century, Sir Henry Goodricke, father
  of the late Sir John Goodricke, had three pips sent by a friend in a
  letter from Rouen in Normandy, which were sown at Ribston. Two of the
  pips produced nothing: the third is the present tree, which is in good
  health, and still continues to bear fruit."</p>

<p class="cenhead">"<i>Another Account.</i></p>

  <p>"Sir Henry, the father of the late Sir John Goodricke, being at Rouen
  in Normandy, preserved the pips of some fine flavoured apples, and sent
  them to Ribston, where they were sown, and the produce in due time
  planted in what then was the park. Out of seven trees planted, five
  proved decided crabs, and are all dead. The other two proved good apples;
  they never were grafted, and one of them is the celebrated original
  Ribston pippin tree."</p>

  <p><i>High Spirits a Presage of Evil.</i>&mdash;The Note of your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span> (Vol. vii., p. 339.)
  upon this very interesting point recalls to my recollection a line or two
  in Gilfillan's <i>First Gallery of Literary Portraits</i>, p. 71., which
  bears directly upon it. Speaking of the death of Percy Bysshe Shelley,
  the author says, "During all the time he spent in Leghorn, he was in
  brilliant spirits, <i>to him a sure prognostic of coming evil</i>." I may
  add, that I have been on terms of intimacy with various persons who
  entertained a dread of finding themselves in good spirits, from a strong
  conviction that some calamity would be sure to befall them. This is a
  curious psychological question, worthy of attention.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Thomas Walcot</i> (Vol. vii., p. 382.) married Jane, the
  second daughter of James Purcel of Craugh, co. Limerick, and had by her
  six sons and two daughters: John, the eldest, who married Sarah Wright of
  Holt, in Denbighshire; Thomas, Ludlow, and Joseph, which last three died
  unmarried; Edward (who died an infant); William (of whom I have no
  present trace); Catherine and Bridget. The latter married, first, Mr. Cox
  of Waterford, and second, Robert Allen of Garranmore, co. Tipperary.
  John, the eldest son, administered to his father, and possessed himself
  of his estates and effects. I think his son was a John Minchin Walcot,
  who represented Askeaton in Parliament in 1751, died in London in 1753,
  and was buried in St. Margaret's churchyard. Two years after his death
  his eldest daughter married William Cecil Pery, of the line of Viscount
  Pery, and had by him Edmund Henry Pery, member of parliament for Limerick
  in 1786. A William Walcot was on the Irish establishment appointed a
  major in the 5th Regiment of Foot in 1769, but I cannot just now say
  whether, or how, he was related to Colonel Thomas Walcot.</p>

  <p><i>Wood of the Cross: Mistletoe</i> (Vol. vii., p. 437.).&mdash;Was
  S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.'s farmer a native of an eastern county? If he came from any part
  where Scandinavian traditions may be supposed to have prevailed, there
  may be some connexion between the myth, that the mistletoe furnished the
  wood for the cross, and that which represents it as forming the arrow
  with which Hödur, at the instigation of Lok, the spirit of evil, killed
  Baldyr. I have met with a tradition in German, that the aspen tree
  supplied the wood for the cross, and hence shuddered ever after at the
  recollection of its guilt.</p>

  <p class="author">T. H. L.

  <p>The tradition to which I have been always accustomed is, that the
  aspen was the tree of which the cross was formed, and that its tremulous
  and quivering motion proceeded from its consciousness of the awful use to
  which it had once been put.</p>

  <p>"<i>Qui facit per alium, facit per se</i>" (Vol. vii., p.

  common law of Scotland, and implies that the employer is responsible for
  the acts of his servant or agent, done on his employment. Beyond doubt it
  is borrowed from the civil law, and though I cannot find it in the title
  of the digest, <i>De Diversis Regulis Juris Antiqui</i> (lib. 1. tit.
  17.), I am sure it will be traced either to the "Corpus Juris," or to one
  of the commentators thereupon.</p>

  <p><i>Christian Names</i> (Vol. vii., p. 406.).&mdash;When Lord Coke says
  "a man cannot have two names of baptism, as he may have divers surnames,"
  he does not mean that a man may not have two or more Christian names
  given to him at the font, but that, while he may have "divers surnames at
  divers times," he may not have divers Christian names <i>at divers
  times</i>.</p>

  <p>When a man changes his Christian name, he alters his legal identity.
  The surname, however, is assumable at pleasure. The use of surnames came
  into England, according to Camden, about <!-- Page 489 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page489"></a>{489}</span> the time of the
  Conquest, but they were not in general use till long after that. Many
  branches of families used to substitute the names of their estate or
  residence for their patronymic, which often makes the tracing of
  genealogies a difficult matter. It was not till the middle of the
  fourteenth century that surnames began to descend from father to son, and
  a reference to any old document of the time will show how arbitrarily
  such names were assumed.</p>

  <p>A surname, in short, may be called a matter of convenience; a
  Christian name, a matter of necessity. The giving two Christian names at
  baptism did not come generally into use till, owing to the multiplication
  of the patronymic, a single Christian name became insufficient to
  identify the individual. Consequently an instance of a double Christian
  name, previous to the commencement of the eighteenth century, is a
  rarity. The fifth and sixth earls of Northumberland bore the names of
  Henry-Algernon Percy. The latter died in 1537.</p>

  <p>As to the period at which Christian names were assumed as surnames,
  your correspondent <span class="sc">Ericas</span> is referred to Lower's
  <i>English Surnames</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Erica</span> will not, I think,
  find an instance in this country of a person having more than one
  Christian name before the last century. Charles James Fox and William
  Wyndham Grenville are the two earliest instances I can find. It is
  trivial but curious to observe, that in the lists given at the beginning
  of the <i>Oxford Calendar</i> of the heads of colleges and halls from
  their several foundations, the first who appears with two Christian names
  is the venerable president of Magdalene College. Antony Ashley Cooper is
  only a seeming exception; his surname was Ashley-Cooper, as is proved by
  his contributing the letter <i>a</i> to the word <i>cabal</i>, the
  nickname of the ministry of which he formed a part. We find the custom
  common enough in Germany at the time of the Reformation, and still
  earlier in Italy. I apprehend that its origin is really in the <i>tria
  nomina</i> of Roman freemen. It was introduced into this country through
  our royal family, but I am not aware of any prince who had the benefit of
  it before Charles James.</p>

  <p>I apprehend the passage which <span class="sc">Erica</span> quotes
  from Lord Coke has not the significance which he attributes to it. A man
  can have but one Christian or baptismal name, of however many single
  names or words that baptismal name may be composed. I have spoken in this
  letter of two Christian names, in order to be more intelligible at the
  expense of correctness.</p>

  <p><i>Lamech's War-song</i> (Vol. vii., p. 432.).&mdash;There have been

  with <span class="sc">Ewald</span> in <i>Die Poetischen Bücher des Alten
  Bundes</i>, vol. i., who calls it a "sword-song;" and I imagine it might
  have been preserved by tradition among the Canaanitish nations, and so
  quoted by Moses as familiar to the Israelites. I should translate
  it&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Adah and Zillah, hear ye my voice!</p>
      <p>Wives of Lemek, heed ye my saying!</p>

      <p>And child, for my bruise.</p>
      <p>For seven-fold is Cain avenged,</p>
      <p>And Lemek seventy-fold and seven."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Bishop Hall, in his <i>Explication of Hard Texts</i>, paraphrases it
  thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"And Lamech said to his wives, 'Adah and Zillah, what tell you me of
  any dangers and fears? Hear my voice, oh ye faint-hearted wives of
  Lamech, and hearken unto my speech; I pass not of the strength of my
  adversary: for I know my own valour and power to revenge; if any man give
  me but a wound or a stroke, though he be never so young and lusty, I can
  and will kill him dead.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">H. Walter</span> says that "every
  branch of Cain's family was destroyed by the Deluge." Where is the
  authority to be found for the tradition, quoted in an <i>Introduction to
  the Books of Moses</i>, by James Morison, p. 26., that Naameh, the
  daughter of Lamech the Cainite and Zillah, married Ham, the son of Noah,
  and thus survived the Flood?</p>

  speculation. One <i>Trait</i> had lands near this stream, and it is

  <i>Trait's</i> Ford, corrupted into Traitor's Ford,&mdash;a locality well

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>We understand the Committee appointed by the Society of Antiquaries to
  consider the best mode of restoring the Society to its former efficient
  state, have agreed upon their Report, and also to the revised laws to be
  recommended to the Fellows for adoption. Of the nature of alterations
  suggested, we know nothing; for while, on the one hand, it is stated that
  the Report recommends changes of a most sweeping character, on the other
  it is rumoured that the changes to be proposed are neither many nor
  important. The truth in this, as in most cases, no doubt lies midway
  between <!-- Page 490 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page490"></a>{490}</span> the two: and the Report will probably be
  found to breathe a spirit of conservative reform. Embracing, as the
  proposed changes necessarily must, points on which great difference of
  opinion has existed, and may continue to exist, we hope they will receive
  the impartial consideration of the Fellows; and that they will bear in
  mind, that in coming to the conclusions at which they have arrived, the
  Committee have had the advantage of sources of information, necessarily
  beyond the reach of the body generally; and that those very
  recommendations, which at first sight may seem most open to objection,
  may probably be those which their information most completely
  justifies.</p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2-1/4 per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
